git format patch adding report webservice, caching support, and public
visibility setting

Patch includes parts of 
https://github.com/ranginui/koha/commit/20cb74d1f5f86ed9fa1e6a1ead29798ff894c685
and
https://github.com/ranginui/koha/commit/2a1f4172dafbfb7435e46762fcfab368d3dceb7a

It also adds in caching for intranet, setting a cache expiry time for reports,
and a public visibility flag to reports.

I still have to add a better user input dialog and user validation (patch
following soon).
Currently the input is just a text field that takes seconds (not ideal for end
user) and the validation is a die message (as the timeout cannot exceed 30 days
or Memcached::set will take it as an absolute time).

The attached patch excluded the functionality added in bug 7248 (so that bug is
a dependency to this).

"
8492||"This enhancement extends the OpacSuppression feature with an optional IP address
range within which results are _not_ suppressed.

"
8004||"When a hold is placed on an item where the pickup location is different than the
holding library, Koha initiates a branch transfer for that item to fill that
hold when items is run through the returns system.

If the item is then run through returns a second time, the system is supposed to
close that transfer as a 'wrongtransfer', and open a new transfer with the same
from and to branches as the original.

The problem is that the original transfer is closed, but the new transfer is not
created. This is because at some point, someone replaced the template variable
WrongTransfer, which had previously contained the branchcode for the library to
transfer to, with the full name of the library instead ( I assume to make a look
nicer ).

The consequence of this, is the the name of the library is passed to
updateWrongTransfer instead of the branchcode, causing the failure.

"
5356||"The library will be able to choose shipping and billing address at basket level.

will be usefull for libraries having a single basketgroup for the supplier, but
different shipping/billing address

directly correspond to currency, but rather is a measurement of the difficulty

For each branch, it shall be possible to specify a numeric value indicating the
'cost' of transporting the item from that branch to every other branch. A toggle
shall also be available to block all transport from any branch to any other
branch. The toggle shall not change the 'cost' value associated with the
transport between any two branches.
Filling Holds using the Transport Cost Matrix

A system preference shall be added to control whether holds are filled using the
Transport Cost Matrix, or not.

If the system is configured to use the Transport Cost Matrix for filling holds,
then when attempting to fill a hold, the system will search for the lowest cost
branch, and attempt to fill the hold with an item from that branch first.
Branches of equal cost shall be selected from randomly. The branch or branches
of the next highest cost shall be selected from only if all the branches in the
previous group are unable to fill the hold.

The system shall use the item's current holding branch when determining whether
the item can fulfill a hold using the Transport Cost Matrix. This behaviour

"
7704||"Problem 1:
Because we want to share our resources and let our branches place holds on any
other branch's items, we have Independent Branches turned off. This also makes
everyone's patrons searchable, editable and check-out-able to every other
branch. Is there a way to make our items sharable but not our Patrons?

Problem 2:
Before migrating to this version of Koha, we never had a problem in sharing
items even while IndependentBranches was on, by using the
canreservefromotherbranches preference.  Once we migrated, we could still share
items, it's just that the automatic transfer back to the owning branch does not
take place.  We could get the hold, but we had trouble transferring the item
home.  Because of these transfer problems, we have turned IndependentBranches
off.

Idea for solution:
The idea here would be to adapt the existing Independent Branches system
preference to let librarians choose which things they want to share
(holds/items/patrons/other objects).  When this development is complete, it is
still possible to transfer an item back to its home library with both
IndependentBranches and canreserverfromotherbranches turned on.

"
7563||"This is a proposition to implement silent printing for slips. 

In opposition to the solution with an additional Firefox (Portable) installation
(see: http://wiki.koha-
community.org/wiki/Using_Portable_Firefox_as_a_Koha_Client), this solution works
with the standard Firefox installation (+ PlugIn jsPrintSetup) .

jsPrintSetup e.g. allows to set printer, print silent, change header and footer,
see: http://jsprintsetup.mozdev.org/

The overall concept is to have a new staff client preference where one can enter
the necessary JavaScript.

If this preference is empty, Koha falls back to te default behaviour.

I did a proof of concept with the following steps: 

--Step 1 --------------------------
Add somewhere to staff_client.pref, 
e.g. near intranetstylesheet:
----------------------------------
-
        -  Use the following JavaScript for printing slips. Define at least
function printThenClose(). For use e.g. with Firefox PlugIn jsPrintSetup, see
http://jsprintsetup.mozdev.org/: 
	- pref: intranetslipprinterjs
	  type: textarea
	  class: code		
----------------------------------
(Suppose this will be pootleized to have translations?)


--Step 2---------------------------
Add somewhere to moremember.pl:
----------------------------------
    $template->param( intranetslipprinterjs =>
C4::Context->preference('intranetslipprinterjs' ) );
----------------------------------

--Step 3----------------------------------------------
Replace hard coded JavaScript function printThenClose() 
in moremember-print.tt and moremember-receipt.tt with:
------------------------------------------------------
<script language= javascript >
[% IF ( intranetslipprinterjs ) %]
    [% intranetslipprinterjs %]
[% ELSE %] 
    function printThenClose() {
        window.print();
        window.close();
    }
[% END %] 
</script>	

--Step 4----------------------------------------------------------------------
Login to Koha, go to Home › Administration › System Preferences (Staff Client) 
and edit the new field intranetslipprinterjs to print silent, set printer etc.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
function printThenClose() {
 try
  {
        //Try to print using jsPrintSetup Plug-In in Firefox
        //If it is not installed fall back to default prnting
        jsPrintSetup.clearSilentPrint();   
        jsPrintSetup.setOption('printSilent', 1);
		
	//Choose printer using one or more of the following functions
	//jsPrintSetup.getPrintersList...
	//jsPrintSetup.setPrinter...

	//Set Header and footer...
        jsPrintSetup.setOption('headerStrLeft', '');
        jsPrintSetup.setOption('headerStrCenter', '');
        jsPrintSetup.setOption('headerStrRight', '');
        jsPrintSetup.setOption('footerStrLeft', '');
        jsPrintSetup.setOption('footerStrCenter', '');
        jsPrintSetup.setOption('footerStrRight', '');   
		
        jsPrintSetup.print();     
        window.close();
  }
catch(err)
  {   
        //Default printing if jsPrint-setup is not available
        window.print();
        window.close();
  }
} 

--Step 5---------------------------------------------
...and install jsPrintSetup PlugIn in Firefox...
-----------------------------------------------
From now on, slips will print silently with Firefox and will show default
behaviour
if jsPrintSetup is not installed or if you make use of an other browser. 
All other printing will behave like before.

8768||"ItemType.t fails because the second test attempts to retrieve a non existent
result set causing an error in DBI
The intention of the test is that all returns 0 on an empty table so DBD::Mock
should be populated with an empty result set otherwise the test suite fails

"
7621||"The problem
-----------
Public libraries and school libraries often have to deal with a lot of age
restrictions, e.g. wit FSK (see www.fsk.de) or PEGI (Pan European Game
Information, see www.pegi.info) and/or with regional rules regarding movies
(virtually every canton in Switzerland has it's own rules).

The classic way to implement age restrictions is to make use of a lot of
categories. This gets soon very complicated, and is not easily maintainable. The
librarians need an easy way to maintain age restrictions per title, otherwise
they will not accept Koha.

I tried to find a robust ad easily configurable way to match age restriction
against the borrower's age. I implemented it on my test server.

The concept
-----------
1) 
Have information about age restriction in field 521 a (Target audience)
The entry can be anywhere in the field. It reads like
PEGI 3 or FSK 12 (or any other 'tag' + age).

2)
Have a preference like 'AgeRestrictionTags' where such tags are defined. It is a
text field with a list like
PEGI,FSK,Age...
(Make things robust by accepting ,;: and space as delimiters...)

3)
In circulation.pm, sub CanBookBeIssued, fetch the value from 521 a using the
tags above. If the text after such tag is numeric, take this value as
$restrictionyear. Add the years to the borrower's birth date. If the resulting
date is in the future ( >today) , issuing is blocked by setting
$issuingimpossible{AGE_RESTRICTION} =  $restrictionyear;

4)
In circulation.tt, part , add:

[% IF ( AGE_RESTRICTION ) %]
   <li>Age restriction [% AGE_RESTRICTION %]</li>
[% END %]	

Result
-------
If a borrower tries to check out a restricted book and does not have the
appropriate age, the circulation module will block the check out and issue a
message like
 Age restriction 12 

"
8216||"Paul remarked in relation to pushing a fix for another bug that SIP modules
continued to issue a number of perlcritic warnings. This patch will add C4/SIP
to the testcritic diirectories and address those issues which are warnings
(mainly return undef and subroutine prototypes) it also removes some dead code
that was no longer used.

"
8485||"I propose adding a switch to the koha_perl_deps.pl script so it is more batch
friendly. I propose -B (for batch) and make it output just the library name,
preserving the other switches semantics.

It could be useful to do things like:

for k in $(for i in $(./koha_perl_deps.pl -m -B   perl -pi -e 's/::/-/g'   tr
'[A-Z]' '[a-z]')
  do
    echo lib$i-perl
  done)
do
 apt-cache search $k
done

(fix it) to maintain a list of debian packages needed, and stuff like that.

"
8649||"Due to the size of the patch, it seems better to put this test on a separate bug
than 5327 where other unit tests for C4 are going.

"
7955||"It would be great to have a tab (in the patron module) with statistics (number

authority searches that are possible. This was confusing to users, and rather
ugly. However, the additional options were useful for libraries with massive

OPAC which can be easily hidden using CSS, but offers the option to choose
whether to look in main entries, headings, or anywhere.

"
8412||"My goal here is to make it so that libraries can use one of the authorized
values (shelving location or collection code) to store the color of the material
and then make that searchable on the advanced search page.

To do this for collection codes you'd need to add the following jqueries:

intranetuserjs

$(document).ready(function(){
$( #advsearch-tab-ccode a:contains('Collection') ).text( Color );
$( #holdings th:contains('Collection') ).text( Color );
});


opacuserjs

$(document).ready(function(){
$( #advsearch-tab-ccode a:contains('Collection') ).text( Color );
$('#item_ccode').text( Color );
});


And update the frameworks to change the 952$8 label to say Color.

How to test:
* Check that new field values stick when maintained on the circ rules matrix

Diagram of the proposed change

Currently the area taken up by the login form on the OPAC home page cannot be
customized in any way (except via CSS). I propose we add another region to the
OPAC main page similar to OpacMainUserBlock: a region which will only appear on
the home page. The contents of the region would appear below the login form if
there were no logged-in user. If the user is logged in, the right sidebar region
would move up to fill the space vacated by the login form.

Though koha enables usage of Amazon's AssociateID tag, in the enhanced content
configuration.  No code currently uses it when generating links to Amazon.  Thus
if a person searching the catalog clicks on a link taking them to Amazon for a
purchase, Amazon doesn't have the tag and cannot associate the account
accordingly.  Thus, any possible revenue is lost.

Places where the tag might be able to be appended:
- When viewing the item details, the book cover art link might be able to have
the tag appended.
- The same might be true for other Amazon related links that koha generates.

See:
http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=636
for more info to help integrate.

Usually &tag= with the associate id following it is what is needed, but further
investigation will be needed.

Sponsored by Middletown Township Public Library, Middletown, NJ, USA.

We have written a subroutine in Koha that will adds/appends data to a csv file
when a notice (hold or overdue) is created.  The format of this file was
specified by Talking Tech.  A cronned script uploads this file to the Talking
Tech server where the phone calls are then generated.  The script also runs a
second time in the evening to grab the results of the automated phone calls.  If
patrons renew books etc. via the phone system, the update is loaded into Koha
with a SIP transaction.

7475||"Right now it is impossible to overlay existing records when importing new
authority records. There needs to be a script that handles the following overlay
options:
* Overlay (or discard) based on matching preferred headings (1xx in MARC21, 2xx
in UNIMARC)
* Overlay (or discard) based on matching LCCNs (010 in MARC21)
* Overlay (or discard) based on matching control numbers (001 for both MARC21
and UNIMARC)
* Overlay (or discard) based on matching an earlier form of the heading
(4xx$w/2=[aeo] in MARC21, 4xx$5=a in UNIMARC)
* Select which record to keep based on the date last modified (003 in MARC21)

file with numerous copies of authority records (every time they are updated).

"
7601||"Problem:
--------

When a new marc record is added, the language code in field 008 Range 35-37
defaults to Englih ( eng ). This makes cataloguing inefficient and error-prone
for librarians if most of the bibliographic data is e.g. in German or in French.

Background:
-----------
The language code for English (eng) is hard coded in the files
...koha\intranet\cgi-bin\cataloguing\value_builder\marc21_field_008.pl
(~Lines 61, 100)
and 
...koha\intranet\cgi-bin\cataloguing\value_builder\normarc_field_008.pl
(~Lines 58, 98)


Proposition:
------------

--Step 1 --------------------------
Add somewhere to cataloguing.pref, 
section  Record Structure  :
-----------------------------------

-
            - Fill in the default language for field 008 Range 35-37 (e.g. eng,
nor, ger, see <a
href= http://www.loc.gov/marc/languages/language_code.html >MARC Code List for
Languages</a>)
            - pref: DefaultLanguageField008
            -   Empty defaults to eng. 


--Step 2 --------------------------
Change  marc21_field_008.pl and 
normarc_field_008.pl as follows:
-----------------------------------
--2a---
Add 3 lines of code at the top of the functions
sub plugin_javascript and sub plugin:

my $lang = C4::Context->preference('DefaultLanguageField008' );
$lang =  eng  unless $lang;
$lang = pack( A3 , $lang);

The code defaults an empty value to  eng  makes sure that the code has a lenght
of 3 letters.

--2b---
In both functions, replace hard coded eng with $lang:

document.getElementById(\ $field_number\ ).value='$dateentered' + 't
xxu           00  0 $lang d';

$result =  $dateentered  .  t        xxu           00  0 $lang d  unless
$result;


--Step 3----------------------------------------------------------------------
Login to Koha, go to Home › Administration › System Preferences (Cataloging) 
and test with empty value and different language codes (ger, ita etc.)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I implemented and tested this locally with marc21_field_008.pl (Koha

sorted by the jQuery tablesorter. See the attached image. This includes a change

more than a bug...

note, public note, and 2 notes for history) are displayed in one line for each.
But when we edit the subscription, it's possible (and tempting) to type the
content on several lines.

We could try to display these notes on several lines in an elegant way (not so
easy because the layout seems to be optimized for one-line informations).

Currently this information only displays on the Detail screen - Since several

putting in the  Other name  information.  It would be helpful if that would
display right under the name or behind it on the CKO screen.  We are having to

example - Charolett Elam actually goes by Mary - but you don't know that on the

8019||"If I select a language in Staff client or Opac, I expect it to be persistent
between browser sessions.

This is not the case. Koha forgets the selection as soon as all Broser instances
are closed, and starts up the next session with the Browser's preferred
language.

This behaviour is due to the Cookie KohaOpacLanguage. I expires when the browser
is closed because no expiry date is set in
C4\Templates.pm, line 298 ff:

sub setlanguagecookie {
    my ( $query, $language, $uri ) = @_;
    my $cookie = $query->cookie(
        -name    => 'KohaOpacLanguage',

    print $query->redirect(
        -uri    => $uri,
        -cookie => $cookie

Patch follows.

"
7784||"In the batch item modification interfaces:

 Checking the box right next the subfield label will disable the entry 
and delete the values of that subfield on all selected items 

I think it's more accurate to say  disable the entry and delete the contents of
the subfield.  Some enhancements:

 - indicate this by emptying/resetting the field and adding a disabled
attribute.
 - append a note which says  The contents of this field will be deleted  

It would also be helpful to add a note saying that leaving fields empty will
make no changes to any records.
