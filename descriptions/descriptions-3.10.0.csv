holding library, Koha initiates a branch transfer for that item to fill that
hold when items is run through the returns system.

If the item is then run through returns a second time, the system is supposed to
close that transfer as a 'wrongtransfer', and open a new transfer with the same
from and to branches as the original.

The problem is that the original transfer is closed, but the new transfer is not
created. This is because at some point, someone replaced the template variable
WrongTransfer, which had previously contained the branchcode for the library to
transfer to, with the full name of the library instead ( I assume to make a look
nicer ).

The consequence of this, is the the name of the library is passed to
updateWrongTransfer instead of the branchcode, causing the failure."

5911||"This patch add a new administrative page that serves to manage the
relative costs of transporting an item between branches. “Cost” does not
directly correspond to currency, but rather is a measurement of the difficulty
of transporting the item between the two branches.

For each branch, it is possible to specify a numeric value indicating the
'cost' of transporting the item from that branch to every other branch. A toggle
is also available to block all transport from any branch to any other
branch. The toggle does not change the 'cost' value associated with the
transport between any two branches.

A system preference has been added to control whether holds are filled using the
Transport Cost Matrix, or not.

If the system is configured to use the Transport Cost Matrix for filling holds,
then when attempting to fill a hold, the system will search for the lowest cost
branch, and attempt to fill the hold with an item from that branch first.
Branches of equal cost will be selected from randomly. The branch or branches
of the next highest cost will be selected from only if all the branches in the
previous group are unable to fill the hold.

The system use the item's current holding branch when determining whether
the item can fulfill a hold using the Transport Cost Matrix. This behaviour
can be overruled if the AutomaticItemReturn system preference is enabled."

In opposition to the solution with an additional Firefox (Portable) installation
(see: http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Using_Portable_Firefox_as_a_Koha_Client), 
this solution works with the standard Firefox installation (+ PlugIn jsPrintSetup) .

jsPrintSetup e.g. allows to set printer, print silent, change header and footer,
see: http://jsprintsetup.mozdev.org/

The overall concept is to have a new staff client system preference 
(intranetslipprinterjs) where one can enter the necessary JavaScript.

If this preference is empty, Koha falls back to the default behaviour.

Example of intranetslipprinterjs configuration:

function printThenClose() {
 try
  {
        //Try to print using jsPrintSetup Plug-In in Firefox
        //If it is not installed fall back to default prnting
        jsPrintSetup.clearSilentPrint();   
        jsPrintSetup.setOption('printSilent', 1);
		
	//Choose printer using one or more of the following functions
	//jsPrintSetup.getPrintersList...
	//jsPrintSetup.setPrinter...

	//Set Header and footer...
        jsPrintSetup.setOption('headerStrLeft', '');
        jsPrintSetup.setOption('headerStrCenter', '');
        jsPrintSetup.setOption('headerStrRight', '');
        jsPrintSetup.setOption('footerStrLeft', '');
        jsPrintSetup.setOption('footerStrCenter', '');
        jsPrintSetup.setOption('footerStrRight', '');   
		
        jsPrintSetup.print();     
        window.close();
  }
catch(err)
  {   
        //Default printing if jsPrint-setup is not available
        window.print();
        window.close();
  }
} 

if you've installed jsPrintSetup PlugIn in Firefox from now on, 
slips will print silently with Firefox and will show default behaviour
if jsPrintSetup is not installed or if you make use of an other browser. 

All other printing will behave like before."

restrictions, [e.g. FSK (see www.fsk.de) or PEGI (Pan European Game
Information, see www.pegi.info)] and/or with regional rules regarding movies
(virtually every canton in Switzerland has it's own rules).

The classic way to implement age restrictions is to make use of a lot of
categories. This gets soon very complicated, and is not easily maintainable. The
librarians need an easy way to maintain age restrictions per title, otherwise
they will not accept Koha.

This patch adds a robust and easily configurable way to match age restriction
against the borrower's age.

The concept.
  1) Have information about age restriction in a field (521$a Target audience
 is suggested) The entry can be anywhere in the field. It reads like
PEGI 3 or FSK 12 (or any other 'tag' + age).
  2) Have a preference like 'AgeRestrictionTags' where such tags are defined. It is a
text field with a list like
PEGI,FSK,Age...
  3) Update your MARC cataloguing frameworks to link the 521$a (or any other one) to
biblioitems.agerestriction.
  4) Add a limit into a biblio record, for example PEGI 12, if you've defined PEGI in 
AgeRestrictionTags.
If a borrower tries to check out a restricted book and does not have the
appropriate age, the circulation module will block the check out and issue a
message like Age restriction 12 "

to do this, it will be necessary to inject see-from headings into bib
